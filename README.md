# Software-Architecture-CMS
This project was a focus on understanding Software Requirements: functional and majorly non-functional requirements (also referred to as quality attributes).
The FCAPS model was employed while tackling this project as seen in the report.

We did 3 iterations of the quality attribute test, having a 7 step process. The guiding factors considered in the project were:

  . Quality Attributes
  
  . Constraints
  
  . Concerns
  
  . Use cases

The 7 step process as mentioned before includes:
  1. Review Inputs
  2. Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
  3. Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine
  4. Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
  5. Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces
  6. Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions
  7. Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose
